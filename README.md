***Testing Depth-First Search***
- Open your command line and navigate to the directory which has the file containing all python code & associated files.
- In the file "dfs.py" you may change the data values of the "val" variable to changes the 3x3 puzzle.
- Run the python code by entering "python dfs.py" or "python3 dfs.py".
- In the output_files folder, you should find a "dfs" folder with the search and solution path.


***Testing Iterative-Deepening Search***
- Open your command line and navigate to the directory which has the file containing all python code & associated files.
- In the file "id.py" you may change the data values of the "val" variable to changes the 3x3 puzzle.
- Run the python code by entering "python id.py" or "python3 id.py".
- In the output_files folder, you should find a "id" folder with the search and solution path.


***Testing A* Hamming Distance Heuristic Search***
- Open your command line and navigate to the directory which has the file containing all python code & associated files.
- In the file "astar2.py" you may change the data values of the "val" variable to changes the 3x3 puzzle.
- Run the python code by entering "python astar2.py" or "python3 astar2.py".
